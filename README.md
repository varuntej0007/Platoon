This project implements a wireless vehicle platooning system using ESP32 and NRF24L01, where a leader car transmits movement commands, and follower cars autonomously follow while maintaining a set distance. The system features a web-based control interface, allowing users to control the leader car via Wi-Fi while the followers synchronize their movements. It integrates optical encoders for precise turning and distance measurement, along with ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection. Additionally, the project supports dynamic role switching, allowing any vehicle to become the leader or a follower in real time.

To set up, flash the respective codes to the leader and follower ESP32s, connect to the Wi-Fi network (Platoon_Leader: 12345678), and control the system via the web interface at 192.168.4.1. The system enables a three-vehicle platoon, where the follower cars adjust speed and direction based on the leaderâ€™s movement. Future improvements will include AI-driven steering for enhanced multi-car coordination.
