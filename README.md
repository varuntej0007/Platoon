This project implements a wireless vehicle platooning system using ESP32 and NRF24L01, where a leader car transmits movement commands, and follower cars autonomously follow while maintaining a set distance. The system features a web-based control interface, allowing users to control the leader car via Wi-Fi while the followers synchronize their movements. It also integrates optical encoders for precise turning and distance measurement.

To set up, flash the respective codes to the leader and follower ESP32s, connect to the Wi-Fi network (Platoon_Leader: 12345678), and control the system via the web interface at 192.168.4.1. Future improvements will include obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors and AI-driven steering for enhanced multi-car platooning.
